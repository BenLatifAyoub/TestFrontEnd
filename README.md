Front-End Engineering Take-Home Exercise: Cheerful Campaign Creation Flow
This project is a functional, 4-screen Next.js application built to replicate a Figma design for a "Campaign Creation Flow." The exercise was completed within a 2-hour time limit, with a strong emphasis on leveraging an AI Pair Programmer (Gemini) to accelerate development while maintaining high code quality and design fidelity.
Tech Stack
Framework: Next.js (App Router)
Language: TypeScript
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Icons: Lucide React
AI Pair Programmer: Gemini
Features
Complete 4-Step Flow: Fully implemented navigation across four distinct pages.
Multi-Step Pages: Complex pages (Page 1, 2, and 4) are broken down into logical sub-steps with conditional rendering.
State Management: Local component state (useState) is used to manage the flow through sub-steps and interactive elements.
Component-Based Architecture: The UI is built with reusable components, including a MainLayout, a Sidebar, a dynamic ProgressIndicator, and specific components for each step.
Polished, Design-First UI: The final application is styled to be a pixel-perfect match of the provided Figma design, including gradients, spacing, and layout specifications.

AI Development Process & Log
AI Tool Used
Primary Tool: Gemini (Google)
Role: AI Pair Programmer, used in a conversational, iterative manner.
Development Strategy
The development process was executed in two primary phases, guided by an initial, high-level prompt:
Phase 1: Skeleton Generation: The first goal was to create a complete, runnable skeleton of the application. This involved prompting the AI to generate the Next.js setup command, file structure, and boilerplate code for all four pages, including placeholder content and functional navigation between them. This ensured a solid foundation before any design-specific UI was written.
Phase 2: Iterative UI Implementation & Polishing: For each of the four pages, the AI was provided with an image of the Figma design. It was then tasked with replacing the placeholder content with a pixel-perfect, component-based implementation. This was followed by a final polishing phase where specific design feedback (e.g., "the avatar is not fully appeared in the rounded box", "center the items in this div") and precise Figma measurements were provided to the AI for fine-tuning.
Key & Most Effective Prompts
The Initial Scaffolding Prompt: This was the most critical prompt, as it defined the entire project structure and strategy. It was highly directive and provided the AI with all the context it needed to generate a complete, working skeleton in a single response.
"Act as an expert Senior Front-End Engineer... Our Mission: Build a 4-screen application. Our strategy is to first create a complete, functional skeleton... Project Details: Framework: Next.js (App Router), Language: TypeScript, Tailwind CSS... Your Immediate Task: Provide all the code needed for a complete, runnable skeleton application in a single response."
Componentization and UI Implementation from Image: This prompt initiated Phase 2. It not only provided the visual asset but also included a key architectural instruction, demonstrating how to guide the AI's high-level decisions.
"Here is the original image... so first we have this page which is the first page : so as you can see that the header and the side bar will always be the same so make them as components"
Conditional Logic and Refactoring: When the initial flow for Page 1 was misunderstood, a corrective prompt was used to refactor the logic. This demonstrates using the AI for rapid iteration and complex state management adjustments.
"No, the CampaignGoal component appears first. When you press next, the page content stays on Page 1, but the component changes to ChooseCampaignType. Only after pressing next again does it navigate to Page 2."
Pixel-Perfect Polishing from Figma Specs: To move from a "close-enough" design to a pixel-perfect one, the AI was given precise measurements directly from Figma. This shows how to use the AI for fine-tuning and detail-oriented work.
"This information from Figma about the components: width: 891px; gap: 120px;... I want to do the same for all other pages."
AI-Generated Code That Required Correction
Avatar Image Rounding: The AI initially placed the rounded-full class on a div wrapper around the Next.js <Image> component. This caused the square image to overflow the circular div. The fix was to remove the wrapper and apply the rounded-full and object-cover classes directly to the <Image> component.
Initial Page Flow Logic: The AI initially misinterpreted the multi-step flow on Page 1 and Page 2. It created a linear flow instead of a conditional/tab-based one. This was corrected through conversational feedback and refactoring prompts.
Design and Architectural Decisions
Component Structure: The application is built around a MainLayout component that provides the consistent Sidebar and Header. Each page is a "controller" component that manages its own state, and each sub-step within a page is its own dedicated component (e.g., EmailSetup, ReviewEmailDraft). This keeps the logic for each view encapsulated and clean.
State Management: For an application of this scale, global state management (like Redux or Zustand) would be overkill. Local useState within each page component was sufficient to manage the current sub-step and other UI states.
Styling: Tailwind CSS was used for all styling. The distinctive gradient border on the active cards was achieved by creating a parent div with a gradient background and a small padding (p-0.5), which wraps a child div with a white background and a slightly smaller border-radius, creating the "border" effect.
Responsiveness: The prompt required a responsive design. The current implementation uses flexbox and modern grid layouts, which provide a solid foundation for responsiveness. However, specific mobile breakpoints (@media queries or Tailwind's sm:, md:, etc. prefixes) were deferred in favor of perfecting the desktop layout within the time limit.
